## What is this?

It is just another CSS framework.

It is an effort of balancing between convenience and customization.

If you want to build app that small, clean and have total control; or simply don't want to use other frameworks. You may give Unistylus a try:

- 💚 Just standard HTML, CSS/SCSS & JS (when needed).
- 🌓 Supports multiple skins in app runtime.
- 👌 No icon fonts; only register whatever icons you ever need.
- ⚡ Imports just the parts you want.
- 🔨 Customize to the bone, at microscopic level.
- 🔌 Drop in replacement (-ish) for other frameworks.
