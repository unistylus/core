## What is this?

It is just another CSS framework.

It is an effort of unifying the web UI development experience:

- 💚 Just standard HTML, CSS/SCSS & JS (when needed).
- 🌓 Supports multiple skins in app runtime.
- 👌 No icon fonts; only register whatever icons you ever need.
- ⚡ Imports just the parts you want.
- 🔨 Customize to the bone, at microscopic level.
- 🔌 Replacement (-ish) for other frameworks.
